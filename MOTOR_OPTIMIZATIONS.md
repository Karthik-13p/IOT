# Motor Control Optimization

This document explains the optimizations made to the motor control system for the Raspberry Pi L298N motor controller setup.

## Changes Made

### 1. PWM Frequency Optimization
- Set and verified PWM frequency to 1kHz (1000Hz) for optimal motor performance
- Updated motor initialization code to ensure PWM frequency is correctly applied

### 2. Full Speed Operation
- Changed default speed values from 50% to 100% for maximum power
- Added optimization to ensure exactly 100% duty cycle is used when speed is near maximum
- Updated joystick control code to maintain full speed when needed

### 3. Motor Initialization
- Improved motor initialization with increased timeout values
- Added retry logic to handle initialization failures
- Ensured motors are properly stopped after initialization

### 4. GPIO Cleanup
- Enhanced cleanup functions to prevent GPIO warnings during program exit
- Implemented proper sequence for cleanup:
  1. Stop motors (set control pins LOW)
  2. Set PWM duty cycle to 0
  3. Stop PWM objects
  4. Clean up GPIO pins
- Added specific pin cleanup instead of general GPIO.cleanup()

### 5. Error Handling
- Improved error handling in motor initialization and cleanup
- Added more robust try/except blocks with proper error messages

### 6. Test Script
- Created a new test_optimized_motors.py script to test full speed operation
- The script uses 1kHz PWM frequency and tests motors at 100% duty cycle

## Testing the Changes

Use the new test script to verify optimal motor performance:

```bash
python3 test_optimized_motors.py
```

Or start the full web application:

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

## Pin Configuration

The L298N motor driver is configured with the following GPIO pins:

- **Left Motor:**
  - ENA = GPIO12 (PWM)
  - IN1 = GPIO23
  - IN2 = GPIO24

- **Right Motor:**
  - ENB = GPIO13 (PWM)
  - IN3 = GPIO27
  - IN4 = GPIO22

## PWM Settings

- Frequency: 1000Hz (1kHz)
- Duty Cycle: 0-100%

## Tips for Best Performance

1. **Power Supply**: Ensure adequate power supply for the motors. Underpowered motors may still stutter even with optimal code.

2. **Motor Testing**: Run the `test_optimized_motors.py` script to verify both motors are working correctly at full speed.

3. **Troubleshooting**: If motors don't respond properly, check:
   - Physical connections between Raspberry Pi and L298N driver
   - Power connections to the L298N board
   - Battery voltage (if battery powered)
   - Motor connections to the L298N outputs

4. **Monitoring**: Use the web interface to monitor motor status and control motors remotely.
